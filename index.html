      <p>Building your own computer is a lost art and one due for a revival. The process seems daunting at first, but after going through this documentation, you will find it to be an easy process. We go over the process, give instructions in straightforward terms, and outline only the relevant information needed without all the bells and whistles. </p>
      <p>Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, and some computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, enabling the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.</p>

      <header class="header">Planning/Tools</header>
      <p>If this is the first computer you’ve built, it can pay to make sure you do a bit of forward planning.</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li><span>Have a suitable work area, with good lighting and plenty of space.</span></li>
        <li><span>Ensure you have all required tools on hand for easy access. Consider keeping a container nearby to hold loose parts like screws.</span></li>
        <li><span>Have a guide/reference material nearby (this guide, or an instructional video). You may also want to quickly skim over the relevant sections of the manuals for the individual parts you’re about to assemble. These are typically included as a paper insert in the product packaging.</span></li>
        <li><span>Ensure your area is not at risk of static electricity, which has the potential to damage your parts.</span></li>
        <li><span>Be aware of safety precautions.</span></li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>Surprisingly, you don’t need many tools to put a PC together.</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li><span><strong>(Philips head)</strong> – Used for nearly all screws, including case and various component mounting screws.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>(Flat head)</strong> – You may need this for installing your CPU cooler, so it’s best to have one on hand just in case.</span></li>
      </ol></code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_1">
      <header class="header">Step 1</header>
      <p><em>Open Case</em></p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Remove the back screws.</li>
        <li>Take side cover off.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>It's easiest to work on your PC with it lying sideways on a flat surface, so the open side is facing up. Don't forget to ground yourself (by touching the case) before working on assembling parts.</p>
      <p>Keep any screws that were supplied with the case separate and take note of the different types. Most cases will come with a few different packets of screws, and they may have different sizes or threads, so make sure to match them up with the correct mounting locations as best as possible. If in doubt, refer to the documentation which came with your computer case.</p>
    </section>
      
    <section class="main-section" id="Step_2">
      <header class="header">Step 2</header>
      <p><em>Mount the Motherboard</em></p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Screw motherboard standoffs into the case.</li>
        <li>Punch out rear I/O plate from the case (if existing) and replace it with the motherboard I/O plate.</li>
        <li>Fasten the motherboard in place on top of the mounting standoffs.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>There are a few different sizes (also known as ‘form factors’) of motherboard commonly available, so most cases have screw positions that will accommodate the various motherboard sizes. You don’t need to install mounting standoffs in all of them; just those matching your motherboard will be fine.</p>
      <p>The I/O plate is an input-output plate, simply a metal cover customized to your particular motherboard. You’ll need to remove the default I/O plate that may have been supplied with your case and swap it out for the one that came with your motherboard.</p>
      <p>Screws and standoffs are often supplied with your computer case; however, sometimes screws may be provided with a motherboard.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_3">
      <header class="header">Step 3</header>
      <p><em>Mount Processor (CPU)</em></p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Locate the CPU socket holder on the motherboard.</li>
        <li>Lift the latch lever to release the hinge, and open the CPU socket cover.</li>
        <li>Holding the CPU by its sides, line up any alignment notches or the triangle marked on the corner of the CPU to the triangle marked on the motherboard. Gently place it straight down into the motherboard socket to seat the CPU.</li>
        <li>Lower the CPU socket cover over the CPU and lower the latch lever closed again to secure the CPU socket holder closed.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>Don’t apply force to seat the CPU. Avoid pressing down on the back of the CPU with your fingers, as any residue from your hands can destroy the heat transfer surface for the cooler, which will be mounted next.</p>
      <p>Another critical thing to note is to remove any plastic packaging around the CPU socket cover before installing your CPU and cooler. Usually, there is a piece of removable hard plastic somewhere around the CPU socket cover, which protects the CPU terminal pins on the motherboard. Be sure to remove and discard this as you install your CPU.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_4">
      <header class="header">Step 4</header>
      <p><em>Install CPU Cooler</em></p>
      <p>Ensure the CPU cooler is installed directly to the back of the CPU metal housing. We’ve heard stories of installations where the plastic packaging on the CPU socket cover (which is meant to be discarded after CPU installation) was not removed. The CPU cooler was mistakenly mounted to the plastic. Don’t make this expensive mistake, as this will cause overheating and damage your CPU.</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>If required, apply thermal paste to the back of the CPU.</li>
        <li>Seat CPU heatsink/cooler and fix in position.</li>
        <li>Plug the power cable attached to the cooling fan into the motherboard connector.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>Some CPU coolers do come with a thermal pad already applied, in which case you can skip step 1. If yours doesn’t, you will need to apply thermal paste to the CPU surface before seating the CPU cooler in position.</p>
      <p>Cable header locations on motherboards vary depending on what motherboard you have. To identify the correct header, look for the labeling on the motherboard. They are always labeled next to the header with the intended connection, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CPUFAN = CPU fan</li>
        <li>SYS_FAN1 = System fan (any general fan can be plugged in here)</li>
        <li>SYS_FAN2 = System fan (any general fan can be plugged in here)</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_5">
      <header class="header">Step 5</header>
      <p><em>Install Power Supply (PSU)</em></p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Mount the power supply and fasten it with screws to the case mounting points.</li>
        <li>Plug the largest cabling connector into the motherboard power connector from the power supply cabling.</li>
        <li>Plug the 8-pin cabling connector into the CPU power connector from the power supply cabling.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>Most power supplies will have many cabling and connectors coming out of the rear. Others may have sockets for cables to be plugged in. We find it easiest to connect the power cabling for each hardware component as you assemble the PC rather than waiting until all parts are assembled and plugging in all power cables at once. We do it this way so that you won’t accidentally forget to connect power to any device.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_6">
      <header class="header">Step 6</header>
      <p><em>Mount Memory (RAM)</em></p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Press to open the clips at both ends of the RAM mounting slots.</li>
        <li>Line up the notch on the RAM stick with the mounting slot.</li>
        <li>Seat the RAM and press it firmly down into the slot. The tabs should automatically latch closed as you press the RAM down, securing the RAM in place.</li>
        <li>Install any other RAM sticks using the same process.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>Most motherboards will have multiple RAM mounting slots. If you install pairs of RAM sticks, mount them in the same color slots on the motherboard.</p>
      <p>When pressing the RAM into the motherboard mounting slots, you’ll often have to use a fair amount of force to ensure it is seated properly. Be careful not to flex the motherboard too much when doing this. If necessary, it can help support the edge of the board with your spare hand to avoid bending the motherboard too much as you press down on the back of the RAM stick.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_7">
      <header class="header">Step 7</header>
      <p><em>Install Graphics Card</em></p>
      <p><strong>Not all computers have a dedicated graphics card. If you have decided to use your motherboard's onboard graphics instead of installing a dedicated graphics card, you can skip this section.</strong></p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Remove the expansion slot covers from the rear of your case where the graphics card will sit.</li>
        <li>The graphics card sits in a PCI expansion slot on the lower half of the motherboard. Line it up and press down firmly to seat the card.</li>
        <li>Put in the screws to hold the graphics card in place.</li>
        <li>Plugin the power connector cables from your power supply and connect to the graphics card power connector. Not all graphics cards require external power.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>When you plug in your display monitor, always use the output ports of the graphics card first (if you have one installed) and not the output ports of the motherboard itself. This will ensure you are using your graphics card!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_8">
      <header class="header">Step 8</header>
      <p><em>Mount Storage Drives</em></p>
      <p>Storage drives come in two main sizes: a 3.5″ form factor or a 2.5″ form factor. Due to their smaller size, 2.5″ drives may need an adapter plate to mount them within your PC case. The exact mounting strategy for storage drives will vary from computer case to computer case.
        Sometimes, you may need to refer to the manual for your case to fit drives into the drive bays.</p>
      <p>Update: A smaller form-factor storage drive has also become more popular and available recently – the M.2 storage drive. If you have one of these drives, you won’t need to use the drive bays on your case, and you’ll plug the connector tab of the M.2 storage drive (which looks like a card) directly into the appropriate M.2 port on your motherboard, no cables needed.</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Mount storage drives in the case drive bays. Fix the drive in place with screws through the case frame into the case mounting holes located on the storage drive.</li>
        <li>Connect the drive to the motherboard using a SATA cable.</li>
        <li>Plugin power cabling to the storage drive.</li>
        <li>Mount any other storage drives in the same way.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>External storage drives will typically come with two connections that you need to make: power and data, so we plug in two separate cables to each drive. The data connection cable is a SATA cable that connects between the motherboard and the storage drive. The power connection cable supplies power to the drive and plugs into the drive from the power supply.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_9">
      <header class="header">Step 9</header>
      <p><em>Mount Optical Drive</em></p>
      <p>Optical drives are optional and only required if you wish to read or write CDs, DVDs, or Bluray discs. Some people choose not to include an optical drive in their PC build if they don’t plan on using optical discs.</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Remove any front panels from the computer case where the optical drive will sit.</li>
        <li>Mount the optical drive in the case by fixing with screws through the case frame into the case mounting holes located on the optical drive.</li>
        <li>Connect the optical drive to the motherboard using a SATA cable.</li>
        <li>Plugin power cabling from your power supply to the optical drive.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p>Just like external storage drives that we connected in Step 8, optical drives also require two connections: power and data. Again, the data connection cable is a SATA cable that connects the optical drive to the motherboard. The power connection cable supplies power to the drive and plugs into the drive from the power supply.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_10">
      <header class="header">Step 10</header>
      <p><em>Connect Case Fans and Front Panel Connectors</em></p>
      <p>Some computer cases come with case fans already installed/mounted within the case. However, you will still need to plug the power cables of these fans into a header port located on your motherboard. The header port supplies the fan with the power required to operate.</p>
      <p>In other cases, you might need to mount your case fans, or you may even choose to run your computer without any case fans at all.</p>
      <p>Front panel connections may vary according to your case but are typically comprised of the same components audio, USB, power/reset/lights, etc. These will be present in the form of cables from the front panel, the ends of which will be hanging loose in your case. You’ll need to hook these up to the appropriate locations on your motherboard.</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Mount any case fans within your case as required using the supplied screws or clips.</li>
        <li>Connect any case fan power connectors to the multiple fan headers located at various places on the motherboard.</li>
        <li>Identify the cabling from the front panel ports of your PC. These front panel connectors will need to be plugged into the motherboard so that buttons and inputs/outputs (I/O) on your case front panel will work.</li>
        <li>Connect any front panel audio connectors to the motherboard front audio header.</li>
        <li>Connect any front panel USB connectors to the motherboard USB headers.</li>
        <li>Connect the front panel case connectors to the motherboard front panel I/O headers.</li>
        <p>Different computer cases may have slightly different I/O connections. Still, both the connectors and motherboard headers are labeled, so use these to your advantage when working out where to plug each cabling connector! If in doubt, refer to the documentation which came with your motherboard, which should tell you exactly where to connect these items.</p>
      </ol></code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Step_11">
      <header class="header">Step 11</header>
      <p><em>Close Case and Connect Peripherals</em></p>
      <p>Before closing up your case thoroughly, you may wish to do some ‘cable management, which means tucking away, rerouting, or removing and securing any loose slack from cables that would otherwise be hanging around loose.</p>
      <p>We recommend using cable ties to neatly secure cables in bundles and away from moving parts (such as fans).</p>
      <code><ol>
        <li>Place the side cover back on.</li>
        <li>Secure the side panel with case screws.</li>
        <li>Connect peripheral devices including mouse, monitor, keyboard, speakers, etc.</li>
      </ol></code>
      <p><strong>Connecting Peripherals</strong></p>
      <p>Connecting peripherals to your computer once it is assembled is simply making sure everything you want to use with your computer (like keyboard, mouse, speakers, etc.) is plugged into the right spot. Use the following list as a guide for what goes where:</p>
      <p><strong>Plug into USB ports:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard</li>
        <li>Mouse</li>
        <li>Wireless Network Dongle</li>
        <li>Printers</li>
        <li>Webcams</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Plug into 2.5mm sockets:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speakers</li>
        <li>Microphone</li>
        <li>Line-in/line-out Devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Plug into ethernet ports:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet Connection</li>
        <li>Local Area Network (LAN) Cables</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Plug into Display Ports</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor / screens</li>
        <li>Be sure to plug into the correct display ports: always plug into the graphics card display output (if you have one installed) instead of the motherboard display ports.</li>
        <li>If you don’t have a dedicated graphics card, plug it into the motherboard’s display output ports.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><u>Build Complete!</u></strong></p>
      <p>Congratulations, if you’ve made it this far, you should have a fully assembled computer! After a final check to ensure no loose screws are floating around in your case and that all cables are clear of any moving parts, it’s time to power on your new computer.</p>
      <p>If you’re new to building computers, it can also help to have a video to follow along with to see what parts go where.</p>
      <p>Need more help or want to see more in-depth instructions for each step? The below video from Newegg TV is an excellent guide to building a PC and is indexed into easy-to-follow sections.</p>
